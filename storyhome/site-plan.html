      <p>
        <p> I’m Chelsea. Designer and owner of Story House Designs. It’s named for my fabulous great-grandma, Margaret Story, who was and will always be one of my favorite people. She was kind and stylish. Everything I want me and my business to be. I have always loved interior design and over the last 20 years I have honed in on my own personal design style and want to help others do the same. I studied Interior Design at the New York Institute of Art and Design and specialize in AirBnb, residential, and commercial design and decorating. I love Harry Potter. I love my family. And, I love my job.
